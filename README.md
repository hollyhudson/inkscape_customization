# Customizing Inkscape

If you find that Inkscape's default bright white theme sears your retinas, here are some tricks for darkening the theme, and moderizing the icons while you're at it.

## Tool Areas:

Navigate to: 

/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/etc

and replace the gtk-2.0 directory with the one in this repo.  This will make all of your tool areas a very dark grey.  

Workspace Background:

You can change the background on a per document basis here:

File -> Document Properties -> Page tab -> Display
click the checkerboard bar to change the color of the background.

But if you want this to be your new default for all documents open:
/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/share/inkscape/template/default.sv
g

and make the change there and save.  Any change you make to this
default file will become your new default for all documents.  You
can also set different page sizes, landscape, rearrange your toolbars
into your desired configuration, etc.
